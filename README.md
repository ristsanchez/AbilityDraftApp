<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Ability Draft app lets a user see their in game match data, save and export the most relevant matches. It comes with a smooth and friendly user interface to give users the best experience. It also includes other features such as the hero/ability/items data tool. Which lets users find and see the current game data.

But why are those features useful? Here's why:
* You might want to simulate a draft phase to see which side gets the better team of heroes.
* You shouldn't give your oppenents the upper hand when playing a ranked match, the app helps you prectice your drafting and analayis skills.

Of course, no one App will serve all people's needs, since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
